X: Training and Test set
y: Training and Test labels
subject: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
df: merge features, y and subject ID

has_mean_std: identify where the "mean" or "std" text appears in the "features" data
has_meanFreq: identify the locations where the meanFrequency() text appears in the "features" data
feature_selector: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

activities: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

feature_names: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
tidy_data_set: Creates a  tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Output_Path: Output Path



The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.



The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
